/*Description-
    A bitonic subarray is a subarray in which elements are first increasing and then decreasing. User enters array elements/numbers and program returns length of largest bitonic subarray.
     For example, if user enters A[] = {12, 4, 78, 90, 45, 23}, the maximum length bitonic subarray is {4, 78, 90, 45, 23} which is of length 5.

/* Time COmplexity: O(n)
 Space Complexity: O(n)
Test Case:
Input:
How many elements? Enter the size:
6
Enter 6 elements 12
4
78
90
45
23
Output:
Array elements are:
12
4
78
90
45
23
Length of max length Bitonic Subarray is 5
